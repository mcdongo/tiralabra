# Week report 1

This week i've done research upon which subject to cover with this project. I decided to go with data compression, since it is an interesting subject. while not being too difficult to comprehend in my opinion. I spent time researching Huffman coding and LZV algorithms. More than that, there is not much to say. 

I spent 5 hours this week.
