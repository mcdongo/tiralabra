# Project definition

This project is about data compression with lossless techniques and algorithms, more specifically the project is about comparing two compression algorithms: Huffman coding with Lempel-Ziv-Welch. At the moment I am also considering some lossly algorithms to compress images. I'm aiming to achieve a compression rate between 40-60%. The time complexity for Huffman encoding is O(nlogn) and  O(n) for Lempel-Ziv-Welch. I'm fluent in Python and this poject will be executed with Python and the language for code, documentation and so on will be done in English. The app will accept text strings and files and it outputs compressed data into separate files.

I'm studying for CS Bachelor's degree.
